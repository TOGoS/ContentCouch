Remote repositories.

You generally work directly with a single repository at a time.

However, this repository might not always have the objects you need.

Therefore we need the ability to pull data from alternate repositories.

Repository roles:
  -repo[:<name>] <path>
    The main repository that will be checked first for objects, and that
    objects will be added to when we commit.
    
    The main repository can specify additional repositories in
    local-options.txt.
    
    If <name> is given, it indicates the name of the server under which
    locally-generated heads should be stored.  If not given, defaults to
    'local'.  <name> should be specified if this repo will be pulled from
    by other repos so that they don't have to under the name that they
    think this repo goes by and local when looking for heads.
    
  -local-repo[:[<my-name>@]<their-name>] <path>
    A 'local repository' is a lical repository that will be checked for data
    that is not found in the main repo.
    
  -remote-repo[:[<my-name>@]<their-name>]
    A remote repository.  The main difference between a remote repository
    and a local one is that objects requested from a remote repository
    will be cached in the cache repository.

Repository names
  <their-name>, if given, gives a short name to the repository that some
  commands may be able to use.
  
  <my-name>, if given, indicates what we are called by the other
  repository.  This is primarily used for pushing heads.  e.g., if we
  are called 'joeblow' and the remote repository is at
  http://example.com/ccouch-incoming/, then we would push a head
  called 'bj0rk' to
  http://example.com/ccouch-incoming/heads/joeblow/bj0rk/<new-revision-num>
