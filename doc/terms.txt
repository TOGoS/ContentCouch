Blob - A specific sequence of bytes.  Commonly referred to by an SHA-1 sum.

Head - A pointer to a specific version of a file or directory with some
  metadata (author, creation date, comments, source, download date).
  Pretty much the same concept as a commit in git terms.

Repository - A directory (local or remote) where a bunch of blobs and/or
  heads and/or metadata are stored.
