- While caching heads, should store heads in cache datastore, not just heads dir

- RequestHandlers as a more featurified alternative to Getters
  - Allow requests with more information that only an identifier
    - verb (GET, POST, PUT)
    - identifier
    - ? content
    - ? content metadata
    - transaction metadata
      - URI as it appears to end-user (for generating relative links) 
  - Responses could contain
    - content
    - content metadata
      - last-modified
      - format/mime-type
    - transaction metadata
      - is the result cacheable?
  - This should make MetadataHaver uneccessary, so delete it.
      
- RdfNodes ought to read relative URIs as relative to the node's source URI.
  I don't think I ever did this.

- Centralize path handling
  - Be able to create a URI to follow a path into any Directory
  - appendPath('active:xyz', 'ferb/gerb') = 'active:follow-path+source@active:xyz+path@data:,ferb/gerb' 
  - appendPath('foo/bar', 'ferb/gerb') = 'foo/bar/ferb/gerb'
  - option to require '/' after last directory or not for path-based URIs

- Create functions to help make photo album pages:
  - active: -> urn:sha1:
  - urn:sha1: -> http:

== Done ==

* When downloading blobs from remote repos, if one repo gives a bad blob, try the next repo instead of just dying.

* A single repository should be able to store separately:
  - data/user   (what the user tells it to store)
  - data/remote (blobs cached from remote repositories)
  - data/active (cached function call results)
  so that users don't have to set up 10 different repositories

* URIs stored in .ccouch-commit-uris should be like x-parse-rdf:urn:sha1:..., not like
  x-parse-rdf:x-ccouch-head:togos-win/togos-image-archives/latest 

* Use TheGetter to get the generic getter.
