- While caching heads, should store heads in cache datastore, not just heads dir

- RdfNodes ought to read relative URIs as relative to the node's source URI.
  I don't think I ever did this.

- Centralize path handling
  - Be able to create a URI to follow a path into any Directory
  - appendPath('active:xyz', 'ferb/gerb') = 'active:follow-path+source@active:xyz+path@data:,ferb/gerb' 
  - appendPath('foo/bar', 'ferb/gerb') = 'foo/bar/ferb/gerb'
  - option to require '/' after last directory or not for path-based URIs

- When downloading blobs from remote repos, if one repo gives a bad blob, try the next one.

- Create functions to help make photo album pages:
  - active: -> urn:sha1:
  - urn:sha1: -> http:
  
== Done ==

* URIs stored in .ccouch-commit-uris should be like x-parse-rdf:urn:sha1:..., not like
  x-parse-rdf:x-ccouch-head:togos-win/togos-image-archives/latest 

* Use TheGetter to get the generic getter.
