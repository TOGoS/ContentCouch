Extended URI syntax:

  <uri>??k1=v1&k2=v2&...
  
  Indicates the thing indicated by <uri>, but with some additional metadata.
  e.g.
  
  urn:sha1:JEBK36HHQ7PZ2OHNTLKJHHQLAM6WOPX3??type=audio/mpeg&name=TOGoS-Narg_28.0.192.mp3
  
  This doesn't affect the resolution of the URI, but gives additional
  information that may be used to handle the result.

URI schemes:

  urn:sha1:<base32-encoded-sha-1-sum>
    This one is self-explanatory, and is already in use by some file sharing
    software.
    
  x-parse-rdf:<uri>
    Indicates to take the result of resolving <uri>, parse it as an RDF
    document, and return the resulting object.  This gives us the ability
    to target the object that an RDF document represents and to differentiate
    between that and the RDF document itself (which is normally a bunch of
    bytes).
    
  urn:x-git-blob:<git-object-name>
    A bunch of bytes referenced using Git's scheme for naming objects.
  
  urn:x-git-tree:<git-object-name>
    A Directory object referenced using Git's scheme for naming objects.
  
  urn:x-git-commit:<git-object-name>
    A Commit object referenced using Git's scheme for naming objects.

  x-ccouch:[//repo-name/]<path>
    A blob in a ContentCouch repo, by default the main one.
    Must be prefixed with "x-parse-rdf:" to point to
