We want to create or update the collection 'yc-photos-ubn'.

Our remotes config says that this collection has a head pointer at freenet:USK@blah/togos-ubn-repos/0/heads/yc-photos/  

Download that head and, if the collection listing URI has changed, create a new entry heads/yc-photos-ubn/27
(27 being the next available integer in that directory).

Download all files listed in that collection into our local repository that aren't already there.
