Command:

  ccouch clone -merge @freenet:USK@blahblahblah/togos-ubn-repos/0/heads/yc-photos/ yc-photos/ 

This will look to see if the latest head at freenet:USK@blahblahblah/togos-ubn-repos/0/heads/yc-photos/ is
newer than our latest head, and, if so, and assuming the lates head we have is #22, download the remote
head to yc-photos/.ccouch/heads/yc-photos/23.
