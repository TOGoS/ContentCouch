== ContentCouch Request-Response Architecture

It's a new set of interfaces that is intended to obsolete the bunch of Getters/Pushers, etc.

Based on the NetKernel idea of about the same name.

Request
  - verb: GET, PUT, PUSH, EXISTS
  - uri
  - value
  - value metadata
  - request metadata
    - hardlink when possible
    - relative path as seen by used to certain directories
    - stuff like that
  - maybe even event handlers

Response:
  - value
  - value metadata
  - response metadata
    - is this uri->value+metadata mapping cacheable?
    - stuff like that
