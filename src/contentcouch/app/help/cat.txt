Usage: ccouch cat [@]<path> ...

Spews the named resources to standard output.  Paths may be URNs, '-'
(meaning standard input), or filenames.

If a path is prefixed with '@', it will be read line-by-line and
non-blank, non-comment lines will be treated as URNs of resources to
spew.  Those lines may themselves begin with '@'.
