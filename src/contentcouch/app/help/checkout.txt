Usage: ccouch [general options] checkout [checkout options] <source> <dest>
Checkout options:
  -link              ; hardlink files from the store instead of copying
  -merge             ; merge source tree into destination
  -replace-existing  ; when merging, always replace existing files
  -keep-existing     ; when merging, always keep existing files
  -v                 ; verbose - report every file visited
  -?                 ; display help and exit

When merging, unless -replace-existing is given:
- only files that do not already exist in the destination folder will be
  checked out.
- If the destination file has the same content as the to-be-checked-out file,
  no action is taken.
- If the content is different, an error is printed and the program exits.
