Usage: ccouch [general options] cache-heads [options] <head-uri> ...
Cache-head options:
  -v           ; show all exports and skipped files
  -q           ; show only failures
  -all-remotes ; cache heads from each remote repository

Attempts to cache heads from the given repo/paths into your cache repository.

If -all-remotes is given, heads from each remote repository under a folder
with the same name as the repository will be stored in the cache repository
under that same name.  e.g.
  x-ccouch-repo://barney-repo/barney-repo/foobar/123 will be cached at
  x-ccouch-repo://my-cache-repo/barney-repo/foobar/123

Otherwise, head-uri can be of any of the following forms:
  //repo/path/  ; cache only a certain set of heads from a certain repository
  /path/        ; cache heads under the given path from any repository that
                ; has them
