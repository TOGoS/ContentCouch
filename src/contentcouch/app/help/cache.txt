Usage: ccouch [general options] cache [options] [@]<uri> <uri> ...
Cache options:
  -v            ; show all URNs being followed
  -q            ; show nothing - not even failures
  -link         ; hardlink files from the store instead of copying
  -store-sector <name>  ; data subdir to store data (defaults to "remote")
  -cached-in-any-sector ; don't duplicate data into the target sector
                          if it's been marked as cached for any sector.

Attempts to cache any objects that are not already in a local
repository into your cache repository.  Directories, Commits, and
Redirects will be followed and all referenced objects will be cached
recursively.  (If you do not want that, strip the subject: prefix off
the URN to cache only the blob.)

By default, URIs that fail to load and ones that are newly cached are
reported to standard error.

If a URI is prefixed with '@', its target will be read line-by-line
and non-blank, non-comment lines will be treated as URNs to cache.  In
this case the URN may actually be '-' to mean standard input, or a
filename.
