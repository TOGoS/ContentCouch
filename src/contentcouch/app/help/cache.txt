Usage: ccouch [general options] cache [options] <urn> <urn> ...
Cache options:
  -v            ; show all URNs being followed
  -q            ; show nothing - not even failures
  -link         ; hardlink files from the store instead of copying
  -store-sector <name> ; data subdir to store data (defaults to "remote")
  -cached-in-any-sector ; don't duplicate data into the target sector
                          if it's been marked as cached for any sector.

Attempts to cache any objects that are not already in a local repository
into your cache repository.  Directories, Commits, and Redirects will
be followed and all referenced objects will be cached.

By default, URIs that fail to load and ones that are newly cached are
reported to standard error.
