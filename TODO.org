** CCouch TODO

Well, I don't like the whole Request thing around which this whole project is built,
so I don't want to put anything major in here,
since I would prefer to put that energy into a less crufty codebase.

But there may be some easy clean-up things.

- [ ] Move source into src/main/java, src/test/java, etc.
  - This will give a space for non-Java test data, etc.
- [ ] Unit tests for .ccouchignore stuff
  - Test vectors in src/test-data/...
